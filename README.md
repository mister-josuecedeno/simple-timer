## Objective

Build a timer that can be used by nurses to inform patients regarding leave times and medicine impact timing.

## Challenge

This was one of my first attempts at repurposing existing code for practical purposes. Because of the modular nature of the code it was very easy to adjust the output based on the client requirements.
